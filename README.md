## Problem Statement

Using HPC, we analyzed the Nhanes dataset and generated graphs that depicted how population health has changed over time for various races.

## Technologies

    Google App Engine    - Used to make and host the flask app
    Google Cloud Storage - Used to store the images created from the python script
    Google Cloud Run     - Continuously Deploy website docker image
    Google Cloud Build   - Continuously Build docker image from git repo
    Cloudy Cluster       - Submit jobs in parallel 
    Python               - Data ingestion, manipulation, visualization
    Pandas               - Dataframe was used to organize data
    Seaborn              - Used to create our graphs, turned into figures 
    Flask                - Used to host website content
    HTML/CSS             - Build frontend page, host figures 
    Google Colab         - Used Jupyter Notebook to collaborate on code
    Jupyter Notebook     - Used as a python IDE
    Open-on-Demand       - Used to access and develop on the cluster
    Github               - Created a repo, Pushed and pulled from the repo
